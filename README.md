# Self-driving-Car
1. Finding Lane: <br />
Use Canny edge detection & Hough transform to find the lanes in a video.

------------------------
2. Perceptron: <br />
Implement the supervised learning by gradient descent on two categories of groups.

------------------------
3. Keras: <br />
Learn how to use Keras to train models.

------------------------
4. Deep Neural Network: <br />
Train a deep neural network for binary classification problem produced by scikit-learn.  <br />
(activation function: sigmoid)

------------------------
5. Multiclass Classification: <br />
Train a deep neural network for multi classification problem produced by scikit-learn. Use one hot encode to encode categorical integer features.  <br />
(activation function: softmax)

------------------------
6. MNIST: <br />
Perform training, validation, testing on MNIST for digit classification.

------------------------
7. Convolution Neural Network: <br />
Apply CNN(Max-pooling, dropout, fully-connecting layer) on MNIST.

------------------------
8. Classifying Road Symbols: <br />
Preprocess (grayscale + equalizeHist) the road sysmbols to stretch out the intensity range.
& Data augmentation to add more training set.
& Neural network tuning to improve the accuracy.
